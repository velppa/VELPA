#+title: velpa â€“ Velppa's Emacs Lisp Package Archive
#+date: <2024-06-15 Sat>

This repository holds Emacs Lisp packages I stored in my Dotfiles.
Some of the packages are clones from Emacs Wiki, some have added
tweaks that I haven't yet submitted upstream or too lazy to advise.
Some packages are mine but they are small and don't deserve a separate
repository.

Inspired by [[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el/tree/master][alphapapa/unpackaged.el: A collection of useful Emacs Lisp
code that isn't substantial enough to be packaged]].
